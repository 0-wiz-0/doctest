## TODO FOR FIRST RELEASE

- integrate sanitizers into CI builds
- CHECK/REQUIRE macros
- debugger present detection (and break when a CHECK/REQUIRE macro fails)
- a message macro
- look at catch command line options
- ability to not run tests at all
- error reporting
- colors in output
- MSVC/IDE integration
- make a compact reporter (for within ide-s - just the file and line number)
- streaming reporters???
- signal handling for unix: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/csignal/signal/
- fixing warnings gcc/clang/msvc (and add more stuff in the disabled example)
- test coverage
- documentation
- benchmark
- reddit/boost mailing list/comp.lang.c++/comp.std.c++/hackernews/hora ot cg/ https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp (also research how to market a new library)

## FUTURE
- xml reporter (jUnit compatible, etc.)
- timing reports of tests, duration restrictions, kill of longer than, etc...
- test execution in separate processes - UNIX only with fork()
- hierarchical test suites? using a stack for the pushed states
- sorting the test order (by file, by test suite, or both, ASC/DESC...)
- ability to re-run only newly compiled tests - based on timestamps of the __FILE__ in which they are - and stored in some file
- error checking of parameters (if the range is valid (first <= last), etc)
- BDD based on the subtests - like Catch
- matchers?
- count the number of times TESTSUITE and TESTSUITE_END have been called and issue a warning when the tests are getting ran if there is a mismatch (also each TESTSUITE should check if it's called directly after a TESTSUITE without a TESTSUITE_END in between)
- silencing warnings - take into account when a compiler (which version) accuires a pragma/attribute/warning (for gcc use -Wno-unknown-warning)
- ability to transfer/copy registered functions from one dll to another so they are put in one set and duplicates are filtered

## DOCUMENTATION
- profile doctest vs Catch (compile/startup)
- defense of macros in testing frameworks: http://accu.org/var/uploads/journals/Overload125.pdf
- whats the library's main purpose
- warning free even with the most aggressive options for all 3 major compilers
- mocking is not included because it is orthogonal to testing and a different third party library may be used for that (google mock)
- property based testing - what it is and how to use it with doctest
- document how to use spaces for filters in the comma separated list (using "")
- tests are ran serially
- document all the options
- initially was planning on a C version of the library but figured that there is no reason to choose C over C++ anywhere
- tests in headers... might end up in different test suites - and only 1 of them will get registered? or might have ifdef-ed parts that get compiled differently based on how/where the header is included...... so not a good practice to write tests in header files
